This mini-project aims to design and implement a highly available, scalable, and secure multi-tier web application architecture on Amazon Web Services (AWS). The goal is to demonstrate fundamental cloud computing principles, including network isolation, layered security, and the use of managed services for reliability and scalability.

The architecture is built within a Virtual Private Cloud (VPC), a logically isolated network in AWS, using the CIDR block 10.16.0.0/16. To ensure high availability and disaster recovery, the architecture is deployed across two Availability Zones (AZ A and AZ B). Within each Availability Zone, the network is segmented into distinct subnets, each serving a specific purpose and tier of the application:

1. **Isolated Subnets (DB Tier):** These subnets are designed for maximum security and host the Amazon RDS database instances. They have no direct route to the internet or the NAT Gateway, ensuring the database is only accessible from within the VPC, specifically from the application tier. Network Access Control Lists (NACLs) are applied at the subnet level to provide a stateless firewall layer, controlling traffic flow in and out based on rules. 
2. **Private Subnets (APP Tier):** These subnets host the application servers, managed by Amazon EC2 Auto Scaling groups for scalability and resilience. They do not have a direct route to the internet gateway, preventing direct inbound connections from the internet. Instances in these subnets can access the internet for necessary updates or external service communication through a NAT Gateway located in the public subnet. Security Groups are used here as a stateful firewall to control traffic to and from the application instances, allowing connections from the web tier and to the database tier. IAM roles are assigned to EC2 instances for secure access to other AWS services without using static credentials. These EC2 use a ENI to communicate with other resources within the VPC, including the AWS RDB.
3. **Public Subnets (WEB Tier):** These subnets contain internet-facing resources. An Application Load Balancer (ALB) is deployed here to distribute incoming web traffic across the application servers in the private subnets. AWS WAF (Web Application Firewall) is integrated with the ALB to protect the web application from common web exploits. The public subnets have a route to the Internet Gateway, allowing them to receive traffic from the internet and send outbound responses.

Communication from the internet enters the VPC through the Internet Gateway, is directed to the ALB in the public subnet, then routed to the EC2 instances in the private subnets, which in turn connect to the RDS database in the isolated subnets. Outbound internet access from the application servers in the private subnets goes through the NAT Gateway in the public subnet.

This architecture leverages multiple layers of security, including VPC isolation, subnets, security groups, NACLs, WAF, and IAM roles, to protect resources and control traffic flow. The use of Auto Scaling and Multi-AZ deployment for EC2 and RDS ensures the application is highly available and can scale automatically based on demand. The distinct CIDR blocks for each subnet prevent IP overlap and facilitate clear network segmentation.

The "Reserved" and "SPARE CAPACITY FOR FUTURE AZ" sections indicate planning for future expansion or specific reserved IP space within the VPC.
